# Path Following

This project borrows from:
* [bb-frc-workshopsbb-frc-workshops / romi-examples](bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples)
* [firebears-frc / RomiTom](https://github.com/firebears-frc/RomiTom)

TODO:
* Consider redoing everything in inches instead of in meters.  Is this worth it?
* Rework path following Constants so we read values from property files
* Use PathWeaver to generate Trajectory.  Output to some kind of text file.
* Create a new Command class that loads trajectories and constants from text files.
* Set up choosable widget to choose different trajectory commands or other commands for Autonomous.
