# Path Following

This project borrows from:
* [bb-frc-workshopsbb-frc-workshops / romi-examples](bb-frc-workshops/romi-examples)
* [firebears-frc / RomiTom](https://github.com/firebears-frc/RomiTom)

TODO:
* Consider redoing everything in inches instead of in meters.  Is this worth it?
* Rework path following Constants so we read values from property files or using our `Config` mechanism.
* Create a new Command class that [loads trajectories from JSON files](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/pathplanning/pathweaver/integrating-robot-program.html).
* Set up choosable widget to choose different trajectory commands or other commands for Autonomous.
